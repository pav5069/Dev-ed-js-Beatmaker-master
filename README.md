# Dev-ed-js-Beatmaker-master
One of Dev ed's youtube projects 

learning how to create with JS. It was alot of fun to create. 
Here is the link to youtube if you would like to create this project. I went on my own alot with the HTML and CSS but still followed along with the JS. I was happy with how much I understood. Getting there.
